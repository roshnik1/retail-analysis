**Cloud Computing Final Project
Authors: Anusha Chitranshi, Athulya Ganesh**

FINAL Group Project Requirements:

Please add your team members in one of the Final Project Group[1-60] Team Groups.

Provide the code, write-ups, and URL to the Azure Web application.

1) Provide a short write-up on which Data Science Predictive modeling techniques would be most suitable to reasonably answer the questions below. Please see The Top 10 Machine Learning Algorithms for model section. (No more than 200 words) (2 points)
Retail Question: What categories are growing or shrinking with changing customer engagement?

2) Launch / configure Web server in Azure (any platform accepted but should be accessible through the internet). Design an interactive web page to do the following (2 points):
* Username
* Password
* Email

3) Create a datastore or database in Azure of your choice, and load SAMPLE Transactions, Households, and Products data from  the 8451_The_Complete_Journey_2_Sample-1.zip Download 8451_The_Complete_Journey_2_Sample-1.zip (Azure SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Mongo DB, Azure Storage Account, etc.)   Please choose the free (No Cost) or Least cost option where possible in Azure.  Create a display page where we can see Sample Data Pull for HSHD_NUM #10, linking the household, transaction, and products tables.  Sort by Hshd_num, Basket_num, Date, Product_num, Department, Commodity.  Similar to the SAMPLE DATA PULL FOR HH #0001 table shown. (You have an option to join the data sets ( Households,Transactions, Products) beforehand in Anaconda or Databricks before storing the DATA PULL in Azure). (3 points)

4) Create an interactive web page that will allow us to search on  DATA PULLs based on Hshd_num.  Sort by Hshd_num, Basket_num, Date, Product_num, Department, Commodity.  (2 points)

5) Web Page with Dashboard to answer Which demographic factors appear to affect customer engagement? (3 points)

Retail Question: Which demographic factors (e.g. household size, presence of children, income) appear to affect customer engagement?
"You can choose to answer with one of the options provided (e.g. household size, presence of children, income); but not limited to them for your answer. " I am planning to be very lenient with your answers so that we can foster creativity.

6) Web App, where we can load the most current Data sets for Transactions, Households, and Products.  I am planning to load new Transactions, Households, and Products for 2021, and test the output from the interactive web page in Question 4, which allows us to search on DATA PULLs based on Hshd_num.
